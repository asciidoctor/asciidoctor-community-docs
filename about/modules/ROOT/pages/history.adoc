= History

AsciiDoc as we know it today has been two decades in the making.

== Overview

The idea of creating a shorthand format for DocBook named AsciiDoc was first conceived by Stuart Rackham in 2002 (even before Markdown).
Stuart launched this new shorthand language and processor as the AsciiDoc.py project.
That project evolved for a decade before Asciidoctor showed up on the scene to become its successor.

The development of Asciidoctor was motivated by the need to process AsciiDoc in Ruby for use by the GitHub application and for publishing the git documentation online.
As the story goes, GitHub was in the process of removing support for AsciiDoc since AsciiDoc.py had known attack vectors and invoking it through a subprocess was deemed suboptimal and insecure.
At the same time, GitHub had started developing a Ruby implementation of AsciiDoc (which would become Asciidoctor) for the git website.
Thanks to a collaboration between developers at GitHub (namely Ryan Waldron) and Red Hat (Dan Allen), they matured Asciidoctor enough to stand in for AsciiDoc.py.
Support for AsciiDoc on GitHub was saved!

Asciidoctor was the first project to implement the AsciiDoc syntax in another language, in this case Ruby.
The decision to write the code in Ruby also proved beneficial for allowing the same code base to be shared across Ruby, the JVM platform, and JavaScript runtimes due to the portability of Ruby itself.

== Timeline

Below you can find a timeline of major events of AsciiDoc's history leading up to the 2.0.0 release of Asciidoctor and the formation of the AsciiDoc Working Group.
