== xref:asciidoc::index.adoc[Learn about AsciiDoc]

AsciiDoc is a plain text authoring format (i.e., lightweight markup language) for writing technical content such as documentation, articles, and blog posts.
If you're just starting out with AsciiDoc, or want to discover what it's all about, head over to the xref:asciidoc::index.adoc[documentation for the AsciiDoc Language].
You'll learn everything from how to make your first AsciiDoc document to how to use advanced language features such as list continuations and tailoring substitutions.

If you need a condensed refresher, or want a glimpse of what AsciiDoc has to offer, check out the xref:asciidoc::syntax-quick-reference.adoc[syntax quick reference].
You can also find a side-by-side xref:asciidoc::asciidoc-vs-markdown.adoc[comparison with Markdown] if you're looking to upgrade.

== xref:asciidoctor::index.adoc[Process your AsciiDoc content]

The AsciiDoc language documentation is primarily about the source you type to compose a document.
One you're done writing and want to publish your AsciiDoc document, you'll need an AsciiDoc processor.
That's where Asciidoctor fits in.

xref:asciidoctor::index.adoc[Asciidoctor] is the core AsciiDoc processor.
It reads the AsciiDoc source, parses it into a document model, and converts it to a publishable format such as HTML using a converter.
Asciidoctor has both a xref:asciidoctor:cli:index.adoc[CLI] and an xref:asciidoctor:api:index.adoc[API] that you can use to invoke a built-in converter (HTML, DocBook, man page) or an extended converter.
Asciidoctor enriches the HTML it produces from AsciiDoc by applying a xref:asciidoctor:html-backend:default-stylesheet.adoc[default stylesheet], adding stylistic icons, and xref:asciidoctor:syntax-highlighting:index.adoc[syntax highlighting] source blocks.

=== Choose a processor

There are three variants of Asciidoctor that share the same code base.
With few exceptions, these variants all provide the full Asciidoctor experience.
From these three implementations extend a host of extensions, build tool integrations, and tooling plugins in the xref:about::index.adoc[Asciidoctor community] and beyond.
Choose the one that best suits the language platform you're using.

Site generation::
Want to build a documentation site like this one?
AsciiDoc can be used as the source format for the content of a site.
A static site generator can delegate to an AsciiDoc processor to convert AsciiDoc files in the site source to embedded HTML, then apply a template to that output to generate pages for the site.
